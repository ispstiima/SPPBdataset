# SPPBdataset
Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) Dataset

## Description
In the following, a complete dataset composed of sex, age, skeletal information and evaluation of patients (both healthy and affected by neurodegenerative diseases) performing the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) tests is presented. Subjects have been grabbed by a system of three low-cost surveillance cameras. Then, proper video processing techniques have been used to highlight the skeletal joints of the subjects.
